# reactivexio

These were exercises taken from http://reactivex.io/learnrx sometime May 2016 but partially revised here.  Additional items are also included as prep work.  Solutions presented are not exactly the solutions that the tasks required, but the results are the same and each .js code file works when you run "node" on the terminal.  Revision in the future is planned but indefinite.
